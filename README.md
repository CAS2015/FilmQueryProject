## Film Query Project

### Description

This project models a film database where you can look at the title, release
year, language, and description of a movie by entering in either the film id
number or by a keyword search of the description or title.


### Tools and Technologies

Tools and technologies used in this program:
* Interfaces
* Database Accessor Objects
* Queries (mysql join queries with prepared statements)
* Maven
* Try/catches and error handling


### How to Run

Run the application. It will ask you to whether you would like to search by
film id number or keyword. After you make your selection you can enter in
either a number or a string to search for the relevant movie information. When
you are done making your selections, you can choose to exit the program or
start a new search.


### Lessons Learned

This project was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed building the queries and using
them to create objects in my java program. Tying what I've learned about
databases into a java application has definitely been my favorite part of the
program so far.
